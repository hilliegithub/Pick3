The Product that we are building: We want a web application to simulate the purchase of Pick3 lotto tickets. For a configurable time period, a randomly generated set of three unique digits for each game is provided to the player. Players will simulate a purchase by selecting one (1) of three unique digits (other two (2)) will be generated.
Prize Amount is determined as follows:
	1. If player matches one (1) digit, they win $2
	2. If player matches two (2) digits, they win $99
	3. If player matches three (3) digits, they win $250,000

Also, we'd like to keep track and display the total prize payout (money won) per pick game.

USER STORY 1

As a user of the application, I want to purchase Pick 3 tickets so that I can win a prize money.


To achieve user story 1, break it down into several subtasks.
	1. Create a basic service that contains business logic for ticket purchases.
	2. Create a basic API to access the service (REST API)
	3. Create a basic front end webpage that users can simulate purchase.
